# bluktrends
An `R` package for anlaysing and forecasting UK HM Revenue & Customs trade data.

## Aims

Functions and scripts designed for key datasets to monitor, forecast and hindcast the effects of SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) regimes.  To include intervals of uncertainty, and identification of outlier events in the time series. Outputs of central interest include a comparative application of a range of time series methods on the big trade flow datasets that are routinely used in DEFRA Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Enforcement and Appeals (E&A), from the traditional to novel tools.  Robust diagnostics to indicate which method(s) may be optimal in this case.
